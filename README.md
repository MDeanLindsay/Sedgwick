# Sedgwick

Most time spent on first slide retroactively finding open claims per month.
Other slides were outright missing data or relied on open claims per month so it felt like a good place to start.
Aside from figuring out how Bus/Rail claims were split despite using similar codes, everything else for the slide was straight forward for all intents and purposes.

Everything initially started in pandas was more a for fun introduction/getting as close to a concrete number of open claims as I could per month as a basis. Otherwise was kind of useful to clean up datetime null values at first.

Sedgwick.py was run on a random gen JSON file from personal pc, was not able to get running on SedwickTxT.xlsx before project was shelved.
