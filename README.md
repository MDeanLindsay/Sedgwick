Most time spent on first slide retroactively finding open claims per month.
Other slides were outright missing data or relied on open claims per month so it felt like a good place to start.
Aside from figuring out how Bus/Rail claims were split despite using similar codes, everything else for the slide was straight forward for all intents and purposes.
